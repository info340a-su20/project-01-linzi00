        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This is a proposal for the project of course INFO 340 at UW. This proposal will talk about a
            problem existed and propose an interactive webapp to address it.

        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>
            <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_management">Weight management</a></cite>
            is commonly applied by both males and females in the world who want to control their body shape
            and to keep healthy. It includes many different techniques including
            <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_management#Diet">diet</a></cite>,
            <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise">exercise</a></cite>, etc.
            It is a complicated and hard process which will need the participant to have scientific knowledge and
            stable determination to keep following the instructions and restricting themselves from food. During
            this process, the communication between people who are doing weight management is crucial for them to share
            their experience, make new friends, gain confidence and encouragement and learn more knowledge and
            techniques
            to better manage their weight. They also need tools to keep track of their weight management process,
            outcome and milestones to better evaluate the effectiveness of their weight management and also stimulate
            them to continue and not give up.
            <br />
            Therefore, an online webapp which could help them keep track of things related to their weight management
            and also provides a platform for people to share and communicate is important for this community. Although
            there are already many
            <cite><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-fitness-tracker-apps-android-913959/">fitness tracker
                    apps</a></cite>and also some <cite><a
                    href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-fitness-sharing-apps-3486489">fitness sharing
                    apps</a></cite> available online, I didn't find any comprehensive webapp for this community to
            do both in one place and to share more types of information related to weigh management besides fitness.

    <section class="app-description">
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Target User</h3>
        <p>
            The target user of this app will includes people who wants to do weight management but lacks knowledge about
            it, the people who is doing it alone and wants to find friends and a community to do it together, and the
            experts of weight management who wants to share their experience and techniques.
        </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            It will be a online platform which allows members of weight management community could share their recipes,
            learn knowledge about weight management techniques and encourage each other easily. Specifically, it
            allows the users to easily share their experience or recipes via text and photos, to interact with
            other members via commenting or liking, and to able to browser and search for others' posts of the
            topics of weight management they feel interested.
            <br />
            It will also includes some tools to help keep track of their weight changes and measure their success.
        </p>
        <h3>Kind of information</h3>
        <p>
            The main information available here will be the articles, recipes and comments posted by the members using
            this webapp themselves. As the maintainer, we can also share some information from creditable sources.
        </p>
        <h3>How will it solve the problem?</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, it provides a solution for people who are interested in weigh management to keep track
            of their process and to communicate with others to learn experience and get encouragement. The platform it
            provides will also give the members a feeling of belonging and help them make new friends with the same
            interest.
